<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Cancer Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemotherapy</li><li>Targeted Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone cancer drugs market is primarily categorized into chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful drugs that kill rapidly dividing cancer cells throughout the body but may also affect healthy cells, leading to side effects. In contrast, targeted therapy focuses on specific molecular targets associated with cancer cells, aiming to inhibit their growth while sparing healthy cells. This targeted approach often results in fewer side effects and increased treatment efficacy, shaping the evolving landscape of bone cancer treatment.</p></p>
