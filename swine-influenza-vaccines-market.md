<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Influenza Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Swine Influenza Vaccines market comprises two primary types: live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines contain attenuated (weakened) strains of the virus, stimulating a strong immune response and providing long-lasting immunity. They are often more effective but may pose a risk of reversion to virulence. Killed vaccines, on the other hand, contain inactivated virus particles, ensuring safety with a lower risk of adverse reactions. Though less effective than live vaccines, they are easier to handle and administer.</p></p>
